# component-library

Web components developed in Vanilla JS. Web components are a way to develop reusable UI components allowing for the encapsulation of a group of individual HTML elements. When creating components, you first use a shadow to isolate the component you are designing from the DOM. A shadow DOM allows the browser to render DOM elements without actually putting them into the main DOM tree. This is done so that individual HTML elements can be encapsulated without the risk of CSS styles affecting elements they were not supposed to affect or undesirable behaviors. Within the Shadow DOM, you can put the elements together, along with their attributes, and translate custom attributes to existing attributes and add event listeners to modify behaviors. Once the component is finished, you can append it to the Shadow DOM and create the element.
